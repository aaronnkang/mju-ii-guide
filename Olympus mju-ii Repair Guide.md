# Olympus mju II Repair Guide: Fixing Lens/Shutter Mechanism

## Why This Guide Exists

I've created this repair guide because there is a significant lack of disassembly information for the Olympus mju II (Stylus Epic) online. Despite being one of the most popular point-and-shoot film cameras from the 90s with a devoted following today, comprehensive repair resources are virtually non-existent. As these cameras age, more are developing mechanical issues that can often be fixed with simple interventions. My hope is that this guide helps preserve these excellent cameras and keeps them working for years to come, rather than having them discarded due to fixable problems.

## Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to repair an Olympus mju II with issues related to the lens/shutter mechanism. This specific repair addresses problems where the camera might not power on properly or the lens fails to extend/retract correctly.

**DISCLAIMER**: Follow this guide at your own risk. I will not be held responsible for any damage to your camera or personal injury that may occur during this repair process.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT SAFETY WARNING ⚠️**: This repair involves working near the camera's flash capacitor, which can store potentially LETHAL voltage. Proper safety precautions MUST be followed.

## Tools Required

- Small Phillips head screwdriver
- Multimeter
- Clean workspace with good lighting
- Optional: tweezers for handling small parts

## Step-by-Step Repair Guide

### 1. Preparation and Initial Disassembly

- Remove the battery from the camera
- Open the film compartment door
- Locate the four screws inside the film compartment on the back cover
- Carefully remove these screws and set aside
- Gently separate the two halves of the camera body

**CAUTION**: The front and back covers will not fully separate because they're connected by the LCD flat cable connector. Be extremely careful not to damage this cable.

### 2. MANDATORY SAFETY STEP: Discharge the Flash Capacitor

**⚠️ THIS STEP IS CRITICAL FOR YOUR SAFETY ⚠️**

The flash capacitor in the mju II can hold up to 300V of charge and may retain this charge for several minutes or longer. Even after discharge, it may still hold around 70V, which is enough to cause serious harm.

To safely discharge the capacitor:
- Locate the capacitor contacts as shown in the reference image
- Use a multimeter to bridge the two contacts
- Maintain contact until the capacitor is fully discharged
- DO NOT touch these contacts directly or short-circuit them with metal tools

**You must verify the capacitor is discharged every time you reinstall the battery during testing.**

**REMINDER**: Failing to properly discharge the capacitor could result in SERIOUS or FATAL ELECTRIC SHOCK.

### 3. Access the Inner Assembly

At this point, you should have separated the front and back covers from the inner assembly containing the lens, shutter mechanism, and circuit boards.

### 4. Locate the Problematic Component

- Turn the inner assembly to access its bottom side
- Look for a small black plastic piece located beneath the metal plate that covers various gears
- This piece is situated near a copper coil (see reference image)
- In cameras with this issue, this plastic piece is often misaligned toward the coil

When this piece is out of position:
- The nearby gears will spin freely in both directions
- The arm that extends from the copper coil will be in an incorrect position

### 5. Perform the Repair

- Carefully push the small black plastic piece back into its correct position
- Ensure that during this process, the coil arm also returns to its proper position
- After correct placement, the gears (highlighted in the reference image) should no longer spin freely in both directions

### 6. Reassembly

- Very carefully reassemble the camera, ensuring all components align properly
- Be especially gentle with the LCD flat cable connector
- Replace the four screws in the film compartment
- Install the battery and test camera operation

## Additional Notes

- This repair specifically addresses issues with the lens mechanism and power functions
- If your camera exhibits different symptoms, additional repairs may be required

## Troubleshooting

If the camera still doesn't function properly after this repair:
- Ensure the plastic piece is properly seated
- Check that no small components were dislodged during reassembly
- Verify that all connections are secure
- Test with a fresh battery
